Invariants:
- If your collateral enters soft-liquidation mode, you can't withdraw it or add more collateral to your position.
- During soft-liquidation, users are unable to add or withdraw collateral. 
They can choose to either partially or fully repay their crvUSD debt to improve their health ratio 
or decide to self-liquidate their loan if their collateral composition contains sufficient crvUSD to cover the outstanding debt. 
If they opt for self-liquidation, the user's debt is fully repaid and the loan will be closed. Any residual amounts are then returned to the user.
